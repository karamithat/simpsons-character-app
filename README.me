# Project Title: Simpsons Characters Web Application

This project aims to create a web application for Simpsons characters. The application consists of three different pages: list page, details page, and add character page.

The application fetches Simpsons characters data using an API connection and displays them on the list page with features such as search and sort. Users can select a character from the list to be directed to the details page to view the character's details. Additionally, users can add new characters, delete and sort existing characters.

The saved characters are stored in local storage and the sorting is always saved. This project is developed using the React library and state management is provided using the Context API. Unit tests are also included in the project.
